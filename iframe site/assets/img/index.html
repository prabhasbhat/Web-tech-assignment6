    <h2>About us:</h2>
    <p>Our club takes care of the amazing dogs and cats on the RVU campus. We also rescue strays who are injured or abandoned pets in need of help. If you find a stray in need of assistance reach out to our Club members. <br>Join us in taking care of your furry pals. Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctaxA1hNYhiSoeuhY55WcJi3qx2-v8BUDO5KxtdcE0SRGyFg/viewform">here</a> to sign up</p>
    <p>The dogs on campus have all been vaccinated and are very friendly. We also have puppies on campus near the SDI (Design Block) area. 
        Join hands with our club members in caring for the dogs. </p>
    <h2>Roles for members</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Food and water:</h3>
        <p>All the dogs in our campus are well-fed by the team members. Volunteers have to go in pairs with the pet food to feed the dogs twice a week.</p>
    
        <h3>Health and Care Role:</h3>
        <p>Our dogs are healthy for the most part. However in the event of an injury to a dog administering first aid is crucial. We also have tie ups with local vet clinics who provide medicine and aid free of cost.</p>

        <h3>Design Role:</h3>
        <p>Are you Instagram savvy and have an artistic bent? If so join our design role and help in promoting the clubs socials on Instagram, Twitter. Creative poster making skills are also needed by our club</p>
    
    </p>
    
    <p><h3>Dogs and their diet</h3>
        Many of us have had the urge to feed a stray animal whether it be a cat or a dog or any other animal<br>
        However , while our intentions might be pure and appear harmless it is important that you or your friends do not feed food that may be harmful or even fatal to their health.<br>
        Below are some foods which are extremely harmful to dogs:
        <ul>
            <li>Foods containing onions or garlic</li>
            <li>Chocolates</li>
            <li>Artificial sweetened foods (Xylitol) such as sweet treats, chewing gum (choking hazard and sticks to their fur)</li>
            <li>Macadamia nuts</li>
            <li>Foods containing Avocado</li>
            <li>Grapes and Raisins</li>
            <li>Spicy food</li>
        </ul>
